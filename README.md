Data Analysis of Toronto Airbnb Listings
Guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

Airbnb currently has more than 5 million hosts and more than 7.7 million active listings. Some of these listings are highly profitable and some are not. In this exploratory project, we are driven in identifying factors that contributes to an Airbnb listing's success. This repository dives into the world of Airbnb listings in Toronto.
